                My incredible New Zealand road trip with Embarq unveiled a new
                way to explore a country. The stunning natural beauty and
                well-developed infrastructure were enhanced by Embarq’s
                meticulous planning. Thanks to their detailed scouting, we
                witnessed breathtaking vistas off the beaten track. The journey
                fostered amazing connections among travellers and elevated the
                entire experience. Every detail – itinerary, local partnerships,
                hotels, and care – showed true professionalism.

                One of the best self-drive group trips I’ve taken recently. Very
                well curated and organised with each person’s comfort in mind.
                Sujal is an amazing trip organiser and a great companion
                throughout the tour.
